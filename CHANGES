   received on our SIP ports.

-- Baseline (from project homepage) :

Main features :

 - RFC3261 compliant (almost) SIP-server, capable of everything a
   generic domain needs :

  - Registrar that keeps track of your users
  - Handles incoming SIP requests to your domain
  - Handles routing of requests from your users to remote domains
  - TCP, UDP and TLS (including SIPS) support
  - Automatically maps e-mail addresses of your users to their SIP
    addresses, if you have the e-mail addresses in LDAP
  - Handles multiple domains using a single server instance
  - ENUM support for PSTN-bypass whenever possible
  - IPv6 support
  - Forking, both parallel and sequential
  - CPL (RFC3880) support for advanced user-control of events
    (currently incoming calls only)
  - Modular user database, currently with LDAP, Mnesia, MySQL and
    text-file backends
  - PSTN destination access control (per user or for anonymous users)
